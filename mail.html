1. Showers and thunderstorms remain separated from the center of a 
small area of low pressure located a couple of hundred miles east of 
the Cabo Verde Islands.  The system is moving northward toward less 
favorable environmental conditions, and significant development of 
this system appears unlikely.

2. A westward-moving tropical wave located about 950 miles east of 
the Lesser Antilles is producing disorganized showers and

possible while it turns northwestward over the western Atlantic
by early next week.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.
